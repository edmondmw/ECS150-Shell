Works for everything except for &
The status of our code is we got the commands cd, ls, pwd, history, and exit working interally. Also got up/down/backspace/delete. Got forking, piping, and exec to work on commands that are not internally handled. Redirection works.
Used a Makefile to compile specifically "g++ -std=c++11 ashell.cpp -o ashell"
